# Learn Chinese Platform TODO

- [x] Add frontend with `@libresat/frontend-framework`
- [ ] Add service for entity with `@libresat/service-framework`
- [x] Deploy docker images
- [ ] Add hashbangs to start scripts
- [ ] Add central configuration/data repo
- [ ] Start adding blog posts
- [ ] Standardize `start.ts` scripts
- [ ] Standardize dirs for all frontends (site should be "just another frontend")
- [ ] TS for data, don't use YAML (to use `import`)
- [ ] Don't query for config data in Gatsby, just `import` the data repo/files
- [ ] Merge `/apps` and `/about` for all pages (or let them coexist, but show apps on `/about`)
- [ ] Add `/apps` to `@learn-chinese-platform/site`
